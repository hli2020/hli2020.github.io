title:  "Scene Classification 101"
excerpt: "We implement a classification system to solve the classical problem in computer vision, a final project that is accompanied with the vision course. Old, antique, out of date features are used to salute to classics in old times before the renaissance of deep learning."

In this project we are required to implement a system to classify five scenes. We use classic methods with feature extraction of the images in a multi-scale framework (spatial pyramid matching) and then train a SVM classifier. The basic steps include:

- Feature Extraction: dense sampling of SIFT descriptors and many other features (HOG, LBP, GIST, etc)

- Codebook Generation: k-means clustering on subset or all of the feature descriptors to learn the codebook. A reasonable codebook size is about 1,024.
