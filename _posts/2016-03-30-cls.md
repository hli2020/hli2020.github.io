In this project we are required to implement a system to classify five scenes. We use classic methods with feature extraction of the images in a multi-scale framework (spatial pyramid matching) and then train a SVM classifier. The basic steps include:

- Feature Extraction: dense sampling of SIFT descriptors and many other features (HOG, LBP, GIST, etc)

- Codebook Generation: k-means clustering on subset or all of the feature descriptors to learn the codebook. A reasonable codebook size is about 1,024.

- Image Representation: compute a histogram vector to represent each image in terms of distance frequency with the codebook. The basic method is called __descriptor quantization__.

- Spatial Pyramid Matching [(paper)](http://www-cvr.ai.uiuc.edu/ponce_grp/publication/paper/cvpr06b.pdf): 
Only local feature description does not have the spatial order of local descriptors, which limits the descriptive power in image representation. Instead we implement a spatial pyramid matching method to consider feature descriptors in different scales (levels). The following figure shows the gist.

<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">Consider a 3-level spaticial pyramid matching. Each level is devided into different grids and we obtain the corresponding image representations within each grid. Then we pool these results within each level and concatenate the pooled representations among levels. There are three types of features in this particular example.</div>

- Classifier Learning: one is linear SVM and its alternative is kernel SVM.
