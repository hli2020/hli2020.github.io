Motion estimation among a sequence of images is a widely used task in computer vision, such as image
segmentation, object classification, and driver assistance.
In this community, researchers use ‘optical flow’ to describe the motion field. ‘Optical flow’ is a dense
vector field, where a 2D displacement vector is calculated for each pixel. The displacement vector points to its corresponding pixel from another image.

Since much of the structural information of a 3D scene gets lost in the imaging process, so does the motion information. The estimation of the accurate 2D motion in an image sequence is therefore ill-posed and has to be aided by additional priors, such as the smoothness property of motion.

> The main gotcha for me in this project is the matrix type convert to its sparse counterpart and use the scipy.sparse library, which took a long time to debug.

Unfortunately this project was done in a rush and most of the following parts are just roughly covered. Much more technical details (probably) will be addressed after the deadline or I am free from saving the world. :) The preliminary results and code are ready, however.

### Pipeline
```python
# Input: frame1, frame2, \lambda

Build image pyramid
Initialize flow = 0

for i in range(numPyramidLevel):
Initialize flow from previous level
Build gradient matrix and Laplacian matrix
	
	for j in range(maxWarpingNum):
		 Warp image using flow vector
		 Compute image gradient Ix, Iy, and Iz 		# tricky part
		 Build linear system to solve HS flow 		# gotcha part
		 Solve linear system to compute the flow
		 Use median filter to smooth the flow map

# Output: flow uv
```

### Evaluation
Once the pyramid is built and the optimization equation is solved iteratively in each level, the result in the finest level is
obtained. We evaluate optical flow results by two measures: Average Angle Error (AAE) and End Point
Error (EPE). They are defined by comparing the flow result with the ground truth. The lower the AAE and EPE are, the better the optical flow performance is. See the [assignment document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3n9idabm4xyesf8/Assignment3_v2.pdf?dl=0) for details.

### Ablation Study
There are mainly two factors could result in the final performance, where I tried several choices and found that 
a combo of the parameter ```sigma = 0.6``` in the Gaussian filter and the scheme ```do median filtering only in the iteration part``` work best in the whale case. However, I believe paramters are still **out there** to tune for each case. The metric below
denotes EPE value.

### Experiments
The following table shows the overall performance of all the eight cases. Weiredly though, AAE and EPE are not consistently going up and down with each case. Sometimes a lower EPE could have a higher AAE (```urban2``` vs ```urban3```). I am not an expert on this field and haven't dived into the detailed definition and meaning of the evalutaion metrics. Also, we see that I might just consider the whale case only to tune the paramters so that they do not generalize well on other cases. A cross-validation pracitce is on call, obviously.
