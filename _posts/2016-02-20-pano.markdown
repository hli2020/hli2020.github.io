title:  "Panoramic Mosaic Stitching"
excerpt: "We implement a system to combine a series of photographs into a panorama. The software will automatically align the photographs based on their overlap and relative positions and blend the resultant photos into a single seamless panorama."

There's something magical about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). I still remember when I trained my first recurrent network for [Image Captioning](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/). Within a few dozen minutes of training my first baby model (with rather arbitrarily-chosen hyperparameters) started to generate very nice looking descriptions of images that were on the edge of making sense. Sometimes the ratio of how simple your model is to the quality of the results you get out of it blows past your expectations, and this was one of those times. What made this result so shocking at the time was that the common wisdom was that RNNs were supposed to be difficult to train (with more experience I've in fact reached the opposite conclusion). Fast forward about a year: I'm training RNNs all the time and I've witnessed their power and robustness many times, and yet their magical outputs still find ways of amusing me. This post is about sharing some of that magic with you.

By the way, together with this post I am also releasing [code on Github](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) that allows you to train character-level language models based on multi-layer LSTMs. You give it a large chunk of text and it will learn to generate text like it one character at a time. You can also use it to reproduce my experiments below. But we're getting ahead of ourselves; What are RNNs anyway?

### Radial Distortion Correction

### Feature Extraction using SIFT


### Global Alignment

### Stitching and Blending

### Putting All Together
Here are some more panoramas generated from the algorithm.
