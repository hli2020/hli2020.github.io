title:  "Panoramic Mosaic Stitching"
excerpt: "We implement a system to combine a series of photographs into a panorama. The software will automatically align the photographs based on their overlap and relative positions and blend the resultant photos into a single seamless panorama."

In this project, we are assigned to make a seamless panorama out of seveal images using proper alignment, bundle adjustment, stitching and blending. The panorama technique is already on-the-fly in most smart phones, for example, the following shows a fancy picture of me taking the CUHK campus.

<div class="imgcap">

<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">The CUHK campus panorama that I took with iPhone.</div>
</div>


> The main procedures of generating a panorama is alignment based on distinct features and blending in different coordinate space.

Unfortunately this project was done in a rush and most of the following parts are just roughly covered. Right now there are still failure cases and bugs with not-so-accurate error analysis. Much more technical details (probably) will be addressed after the deadline or I am free from saving the world. :) Extra credits are highlighted in the context below.

Parameters used in this project, where most of them are not carefully tuned and kept the same in all cases.

```javascript
f = 595;					// focal lenth of the camera
k1 = 0;						// paramater in radial distortion
k2 = 0;						// paramater in radial distortion
minMatches = 20;			// the minimum number of feature matches in two images
nRANSAC = 100;				// iteration
RANSACthresh = 10;			// threshold for counting the number of inliers
bundleAdjustIters = 8;		// iteration times of bundle adjustment
blendRadius = 200;			// blending range
```

### Radial Distortion Correction
Involved rountines: ```WarpRDField``` in ```WarpSpherical.cpp```.

### Feature Extraction using SIFT
Third-party software to extract SIFT features directly out of ```.pgm``` images.

### Global Alignment
This is the most hacky part. Basically it contains __global alignment__ between any two images among the candidates and __bundle adjustment__ to deal with drift problem.

### Stitching and Blending

### Putting All Together
Here are some more panoramas generated from the algorithm.
