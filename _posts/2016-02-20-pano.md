title:  "Panoramic Mosaic Stitching"
excerpt: "We implement a system to combine a series of photographs into a panorama. The software will automatically align the photographs based on their overlap and relative positions and blend the resultant photos into a single seamless panorama."

In this project, we are assigned to make a seamless panorama out of seveal images using proper alignment, bundle adjustment, stitching and blending. The panorama technique is already on-the-fly in most smart phones, for example, the following shows a fancy picture of me taking the CUHK campus.

> The main procedures of generating a panorama is alignment based on distinct features and blending in different coordinate space.

Unfortunately this project was done in a rush and most of the following parts are just roughly covered. Right now there are still failure cases and bugs with not-so-accurate error analysis. Much more technical details (probably) will be addressed after the deadline or I am free from saving the world. :) Extra credits are highlighted in the context below.

* Results
* [Code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/igsxdam7seqxyz6/pano_code.zip?dl=0)
* [TGA converter](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u94zemdckmc9gm2/TotalImageConverter.exe?dl=0)

Parameters used in this project, where most of them are not carefully tuned and kept the same in all cases.

```javascript
f = 595;					// focal lenth of the camera
k1 = 0;						// paramater in radial distortion
k2 = 0;						// paramater in radial distortion
minMatches = 20;			// the minimum number of feature matches in two images
nRANSAC = 100;				// iteration
RANSACthresh = 10;			// threshold for counting the number of inliers
bundleAdjustIters = 8;		// iteration times of bundle adjustment
blendRadius = 200;			// blending range
```

### Radial Distortion Correction
Involved rountines: <br/>
```WarpRDField``` in ```WarpSpherical.cpp```.

### Feature Extraction using SIFT
Third-party software to extract SIFT features directly out of ```.pgm``` images.

### Global Alignment
This is the most hacky part. Basically it contains __global alignment__ between any two images among the candidates and __bundle adjustment__ to deal with drift problem.

Involved rountines: <br/>
```alignImagePair, countInliers, leastSquaresFit``` in ```FeatureAlign.cpp```. <br/>
```initGlobalAlign, bundleAdjust``` in ```GlobalAlign.cpp```.

**Extra credit:** <br/>
* ```MatchFeatures``` in ```GlobalAlign.cpp```. I set a threshold (=0.5) to ensure that the best match (smallest distance) should be smaller than the second best one, otherwise, set ```feat_match.id = -1```.
* Bundle adjustment as instructed in the project page.


### Stitching and Blending
Involved rountines: <br/>
```WarpSphericalField``` in ```WarpSpherical.cpp```. <br/>
```SetImageAlpha, AccumulateBlend, NormalizeBlend``` in ```BlendImages.cpp```.

### Putting All Together
Here are some panoramas. Analysis is depicted in the caption field of each image.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/pano/results/mountain.png">
<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">The mountain. We can see the separate images are well aligned and blended.  <a href="http://hli2020.github.io/assets/pano/pano_view/mountain.html">360-degree view</a>.</div>
</div>

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/pano/results/home.png">
<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">Panorama collected by myself. <a href="http://hli2020.github.io/assets/pano/pano_view/home.html">360-degree view</a>.</div>
</div>

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/pano/results/paloAlto.png">
<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">Palo Alto with RANSAC threshold 10, which has some bugs when blending but slightly better than the one below. <a href="http://hli2020.github.io/assets/pano/pano_view/paloAlto.html">360-degree view</a>.</div>
</div>

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/pano/results/paloAlto_b_lowThres.png">
<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">Palo Alto with low RANSAC threshold (from 10 to 5). We can see this parameter plays an important role in generating good results with blending. <a href="http://hli2020.github.io/assets/pano/pano_view/paloAlto_b_lowThres.html">360-degree view</a>.</div>
</div>

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/pano/results/piazza.png">
<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">Piazza. The panorama is not properly aligned, :(, which could result from a mismatch in focal length. Also I tried to tune the blendRadius parameter, but obtained similar result. <a href="http://hli2020.github.io/assets/pano/pano_view/piazza.html">360-degree view</a>.</div>
</div>

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/pano/results/piazza_b.png">
<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">Piazza with bundle adjustment. The odd thing is that in my experiment the bundle adjustment seems not working in this case. Maybe the focal length is not proper tuned. <a href="http://hli2020.github.io/assets/pano/pano_view/piazza_b.html">360-degree view</a>.</div>


</div>

Also there comes a bug that I haven't fixed in  the ```MSLobby.jpg``` case.
The code fails when updating the match quality for its neighbor images (line 285-293, GlobalAlign.cpp), which I haven't figured out the reason.
