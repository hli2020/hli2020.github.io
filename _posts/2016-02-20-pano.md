title:  "Panoramic Mosaic Stitching"
excerpt: "We implement a system to combine a series of photographs into a panorama. The software will automatically align the photographs based on their overlap and relative positions and blend the resultant photos into a single seamless panorama."

In this project, we are assigned to make a seamless panorama out of seveal images using proper alignment, bundle adjustment, stitching and blending. The panorama technique is already on-the-fly in most smart phones, for example, the following shows a fancy picture of me taking the CUHK campus.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/pano/cuhkpano.jpeg">
<div class="thecap" style="text-align:justify">The CUHK campus panorama that I took with iPhone.</div>
</div>


> The main procedures of generating a panorama is alignment based on distinct features and blending in different coordinate space.


### Radial Distortion Correction

### Feature Extraction using SIFT


### Global Alignment

### Stitching and Blending

### Putting All Together
Here are some more panoramas generated from the algorithm.
